# Cannabinode

## Description
Cannabinode is a website that allows the user to view and purchase marijuana products, much like dispensaries where marijuana is legal in the US. The homne page contains all of the inventory, which can be filtered by both the type and form the marijuana comes in. The user also has the option to click on an individual item to view more information about that particular item. There is also an "Education" page, which offers the user useful information regardng marijuana consumption.
